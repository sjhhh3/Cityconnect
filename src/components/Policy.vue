            <p>We respect your privacy.</p>

            <p>Any personal information you provide to us including and similar to your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address will not be released, sold, or rented to any entities or individuals outside of our organization except as noted below.</p>
            <p class="title white--text mt-5">Our Service Providers. </p>
            <p>We may share your personal information with companies (including our affiliates) that perform services on our behalf, for example, companies that help process credit card payments. Our service providers are required by contract to protect the confidentiality of the personal information we share with them and to use it only to provide specific services on our behalf.</p>
            <p class="title white--text mt-5">Business Transfers. </p>
            <p>Your personal information may be transferred to another entity (either an affiliated entity or an unrelated third party) in connection with a merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar corporate event. If such a transfer were ever to occur, the acquiring entityâ€™s use of your personal information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p class="title white--text mt-5">Government and Legal Disclosures. </p>
            <p>We may disclose the personal information we collect through this Site, when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law (or a court order or subpoena); to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce our Terms and Conditions or other agreements that govern your use of this Site; or to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, or others.</p>

            <p class="title white--text mt-5">Cookies. </p>
            <p>A "cookie" is a small data text file that is placed in your browser and allows us to recognize you each time you visit this site (personalization, etc).
